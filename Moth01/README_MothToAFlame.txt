# Moth to a Flame - Audio-Visual Interactive Experience

## Concept Description

Each scene presents a unique interpretation of moths, lighting effects, and generative visuals, with the central metaphor revolving around moths' attraction to light and the cyclical nature of transformation. By blending these symbolic elements with a visually striking, neon-green aesthetic, the artwork creates an immersive experience where the visuals respond to user input and music in real-time.

## Key Features:

1. **Four Dynamic Visual Scenes**:  
   The artwork cycles between four distinct scenes, each offering a different visual concept:
   - **Scene 1**: A moth (Moth01) follows the mouse, mimicking the creature’s erratic yet mesmerizing movement. The moth scales slightly with random size variations.
   - **Scene 2**: A stationary moth (Moth02) in the top-right corner appears as a static yet significant part of the composition.
   - **Scene 3**: Another moth (Moth03) sits in the bottom-left corner, juxtaposing its counterpart in Scene 2. The grid tiling effect comes into play here, adding an element of geometric repetition to the piece.
   - **Scene 4**: A rotating, reflective 3D cube, featuring images of moths on each face, symbolizes transformation. The cube reacts to audio input, scaling based on sound intensity, adding a meditative and immersive dimension to the work.

2. **Audio-Reactive Cube**:  
   In Scene 4, the central 3D cube reacts to audio peaks from the accompanying music. The size of the cube grows and contracts in sync with the sound, creating a rhythmic, immersive experience that draws the viewer deeper into the visual interpretation of the audio.

3. **Glitch and Radar Effects**:  
   Two key visual effects are featured throughout:
   - **Glitch Effect** ('g' key): Creates a ripple of neon green lines that distort and ripple across the canvas, adding a glitchy, cyber-aesthetic to the visuals.
   - **Radar Effect** ('o' key): Expanding neon-green circle outlines emerge from the center of the screen, mimicking a radar pulse. The expansion rate is tied to the audio, creating a rhythmically pulsing effect.

4. **Generative Art Elements**:  
   The piece employs generative art techniques through random placement and scaling of visual elements:
   - **Neon Squares** ('h' key): Randomly placed neon green squares appear across the screen, adding bursts of energy and movement.
   - **Pixel Moths** ('m' key): Neon green squares appear randomly, representing moths as pixelated, digital elements scattered across the canvas.

5. **Typography & Text**:  
   A central textual theme, “LIKE A MOTH TO A FLAME,” is presented in random arrangements across the canvas. The letters, presented in alternating gothic and modern fonts, are scattered across the screen in white or neon green, reinforcing the metaphor of inevitable attraction and the cyclical pull towards light.

6. **Tiling and Grid Effects**:  
   The artwork also explores symmetry and repetition through tiling effects. In Scenes 2 and 3, images of moths are tiled into grids of various sizes, evoking a sense of order and pattern within the chaos of the more freeform generative elements.

## Controls:
- **Scene Switching**: Press '1' for Scene 1, '2' for Scene 2, '3' for Scene 3, and '4' for Scene 4.
- **Glitch Effect** ('g' key): Activates neon green ripple-like glitch lines across the screen.
- **Radar Effect** ('o' key): Expanding radar circles pulse from the center of the screen.
- **Text Generation** ('s' key): Generates random letters from the phrase “LIKE A MOTH TO A FLAME.”
- **Tile Effect** ('t' key): Activates grid-based tiling of moth images across the screen.
- **Neon Squares** ('h' key): Random neon squares appear on the canvas.
- **Pixel Moths** ('m' key): Random neon pixel moths appear, mimicking a swarm.

This audio-visual experience blends symbolic imagery with real-time interaction and audio-reactive elements, creating an evolving narrative of light, attraction, and transformation.
